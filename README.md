# Facial-Recognition-Attendance-System

## Overview
This project is a Facial Recognition Attendance System implemented in Python using the OpenCV library. The system utilizes computer vision techniques to recognize faces in images or live video streams, allowing for automated attendance tracking.

## Features
1.Face Detection: Utilizes OpenCV's pre-trained Haarcascades for accurate face detection. <br/>
2.Facial Recognition: Employs a facial recognition algorithm to identify individuals based on facial features. <br/>
3.Attendance Tracking: Automatically logs attendance data, including timestamps and participant details. <br/>
4.User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive interface for easy deployment and usage. <br/>
5.Real-time Monitoring: Supports real-time face recognition for instant attendance updates. <br/>

## Installation
1.Clone the repository <br/>
2.cd facial-recognition-attendance <br/>
3.Install dependencies:pip install -r requirements.txt <br/>
4.Run the system:python main.py <br/>

## Usage
1.Launch the application by running main.py. <br/>
2.Capture faces for training by providing sample images in the designated directory. <br/>
3.Start the attendance system, and the program will recognize and log attendance based on detected faces. <br/>


## Dependencies
Python 3.x <br/>
OpenCV <br/>
NumPy <br/>
